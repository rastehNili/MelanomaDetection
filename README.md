# Melanoma Detection
> Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.

## General Information
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

This assignment uses a dataset of about 2357 images of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.
